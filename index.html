        <strong> Game and engine choosing </strong>:<br>
	Week 1: No class<br>
	Week 2: introdution<br>
	Week 3: Unreal and Unity introdution<br>
	Week 4: We decided to choose Unreal Engin4 as our game developing 
	engine because it was so poweful and we both liked to learn C++ 
	coding language, And we finally decided what our game is going to be like<br>
        </td>

        <strong> First presentation and start working on Game </strong>:<br>
	Week 1: we presented our game proposal and started sharing and watching 
	tuterials of unreal game enginge game development<br>
	Week 2: we started finding the best way to share and work on the game 
	simultaniously we found out we could use SVN as a source control and share 
	assets with other but we ended up using github because it seemed to be the 
	best way to share<br>
	Week 3: we started working on game seprately because we were not still able 
	to share so we both made the basic map and added the basic playor behavior 
	like adding buttons and basic stuff David worked on creating the first-person 
	character, controller, torch controller, movements and actions related to them 
	and he worked on designing the level maps. He developed three levels of the game 
	and added all the blueprints and contents.
	I worked on Enemy AI and I built three types of enemies which were looking at 
	the player and shooting and following the player, but I had some problem with 
	connecting The enemy movements to players position and movements so David 
	helped me through that and we found out the problem was with the pawn setting <br>
	Week 4: We still have difficulties with github and we can not update what we 
	worked on for each other. David developed new town board and i added a new 
	enemy but we are still getting erros from <em>Github</em>

        <strong> First Playable and Game Development </strong>:<br>
        Week 1: Im trying to add diffrent types of enemies which will have diffrent 
	shapes,power and behaviours.Also trying to import characters from mixamo to 
	unreal. David also got Keys and doors seted up in level 1 added E key input 
	to open the door.<br>
        Week 2: Added a new shooting enemy and downloaded a crossbow skeletal mesh 
	from opengameart. Got the enemy to kill the player and restart the level 
	after killing.<br>
        Week 3: Added the health bar. David added animations but Accidentaly I 
	overwrote them while using github and push and pulls so David had to fix 
	that again.For some reason enemy is not working (the damage isn't going down) 
	and we have our presentation tomorrow so David's idea was to combine health 
	bar with our previous enemy so that we could show we got the health bar 
	and we can have it working.<br>
	Week 4: We've got enemy walking around at a walking speed, he runs when 
	he sees player, when he gets close he hits you, health bar goes down 
	and when completely depletes the game resets to townboard. 
	David also added a key model.<br>

	<strong> 2/4 Check-In and Final Presentation </strong>:<br>
	Week 1: David Added the attack action into player, so once you press mouse 
	button 4 times it will kill he enemy and I added the Main Menu UI.<br>
	Week 2: Made some changes to the level 2 and David added a sword to the 
	torch controller. Im also improving the pawn sensing on Shooting enemy and 
	try to make it act a little bit more natrural like a human!
	Week 3: I have been working on adding Pause menue, inventory system and 
	objective system. David is working to add a coin or bank system to get the 
	win/loos state run.
